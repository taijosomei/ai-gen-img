## Text Based Image Editing

Creating an Open Source alternative for GenerativeFill and other editing tools.

### Through this notebook we aim to: 

- Provide an Edit Prompt
- Provide an Image
- Edit the Image based on the initial Prompt

### How do we propose to do this?

- Accept an `edit_prompt` and an `image` as input
- Use a Vision Model to `caption` the image
- Pass the `edit_prompt` through a language model to extract the source entity
- Create a `replacement_caption` where the source entity of the original image is swapped with the target entity in the `edit_prompt`
- Use the source entity to create a segmentation mask using OWL-VIT and SAM
- Use the mask and the `replacement_caption` for image inpainting

The pipeline is shown in the figure below:

## TO-DOs

This repository is still in its early stages and will require additional work.

- Better Captioning from Vision Model
- Prompt upsampling using the Language Model
- More complex editing tasks than replacement
- Optimization of the models and an end-to-end pipeline
